# Time Tracker Access Control Documentation

## Overview

The Time Tracker system implements a multi-layered access control system with:
- **Organization-level isolation** - Complete data separation between organizations
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Three main roles with different permission levels
- **Team-based membership** - Users must be team members to access projects
- **Project-level access** - Explicit membership required for project operations

---

## Access Control Hierarchy

```
Organization
├── Users (with roles: admin, manager, member)
├── Teams
│   └── Team Members (inherit user roles)
└── Projects
    └── Project Members (inherit team roles)
```

## Team-Based Access Control

### Team Membership Requirements
- **All users must be team members** to access projects
- **Team roles inherit from user roles** (admin, manager, member)
- **Project membership requires team membership**

### Team Role Inheritance
```
User Role → Team Role → Project Access
Admin    → Admin     → Full project control
Manager  → Manager   → Project management rights
Member   → Member    → Basic project access
```

---

## Project-Level Access Control

### Project Membership Rules
1. **Only project owner and members can access project**
2. **Project members inherit their team role**
3. **Team membership is prerequisite for project membership**

### Project Access Matrix

| Action | Project Owner | Project Member (Admin) | Project Member (Manager) | Project Member (Member) | Non-Member |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| View Project | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit Project | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete Project | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage Members | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create Tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit Tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅** | ❌ |
| Delete Tasks | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

*\* Only if user has system-level delete permissions*  
*\*\* Only own tasks*

## Task Access Control

### Task Operation Rules

#### ✅ **Task Creation:**
- **Required:** Project membership (owner or member)
- **Process:** User selects from accessible projects only
- **Inheritance:** Task inherits project's access control

#### ✅ **Task Viewing:**
- **Required:** Project membership
- **Scope:** Can view all tasks in accessible projects

#### ✅ **Task Editing:**
- **Admin/Manager:** Can edit any task in accessible projects
- **Member:** Can edit only own tasks
- **Project Owner:** Can edit all tasks in project

- Project name and owner
- Current project members
- User's current status

**Solution Guidance:**
- Contact project owner to request membership
- Ask team admin to add to project
- Verify team membership status

#### 2. **No Available Projects**

---

## Organization Isolation

### Multi-Tenant Security
- **Complete data separation** between organizations
- **No cross-organization access** under any circumstances
- **Organization-scoped queries** on all operations
- **User organization validation** on every request

### Data Boundaries
```
Organization A:
├── Users, Teams, Projects, Tasks (Org A only)
└── Complete isolation from other organizations

Organization B:
├── Users, Teams, Projects, Tasks (Org B only)
└── No access to Organization A data
```

---

## Permission Enforcement Points

### Backend Route Protection
1. **Authentication required** - Valid user session
2. **Organization middleware** - User organization validation
3. **Role-based checks** - Permission verification
4. **Resource-level access** - Project/task membership validation

### Frontend Access Control
1. **Route protection** - Role-based routing
2. **Component-level** - Conditional rendering based on permissions
3. **Button/action disabling** - UI feedback for insufficient permissions
4. **Error message display** - Detailed explanation of access issues

---

## Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators
1. **Regular permission audits** - Review user roles quarterly
2. **Team structure planning** - Organize teams by project needs
3. **Project access management** - Add users to relevant projects
4. **User onboarding** - Ensure proper team assignments

### For Managers
1. **Project member management** - Keep project memberships updated
2. **Team coordination** - Ensure team members have appropriate access
3. **Access requests handling** - Process project access requests promptly

### For Members
1. **Request access properly** - Contact project owners for membership
2. **Understand limitations** - Know your role's capabilities
3. **Report access issues** - Contact administrators for help

---

## Troubleshooting Common Access Issues

### "Cannot create tasks"
**Cause:** User not a member of any project  
**Solution:** Request project membership from project owner

### "Project not found"
**Cause:** User trying to access project they're not a member of  
**Solution:** Request to be added to project or verify project exists

### "Access denied"
**Cause:** Insufficient permissions for requested action  
**Solution:** Check role requirements or request permission upgrade

### "No projects available"
**Cause:** User not a member of any team or projects  
**Solution:** Contact administrator to be added to appropriate teams

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- ✅ Organization-level data isolation
- ✅ Role-based access enforcement
- ✅ Project membership validation
- ✅ Team-based access control

### Audit Trail
- ✅ All access attempts logged
- ✅ Permission changes tracked
- ✅ Failed access attempts recorded
- ✅ User action monitoring

### Principle of Least Privilege
- ✅ Users granted minimum necessary permissions
- ✅ Explicit membership required for access
- ✅ Role-based permission inheritance
